# Melon Bomber

### This is a plugin developed for Minecraft 1.9 to add the Melon Bomber gamemode from Garry's Mod.

### Features:
* Game rounds
* Upgrade pickups
* Sliding exploding melons

Melon Bomber is a plugin I was developing for a test hub server. I wanted to experiment implementing a gamemode idea from one of my favorite games, Garry's Mod. Overall it turned out to be very enjoyable to play but lacks core features such as stat saving and multi-server support.
