# Melon Bomber

### This is a plugin developed for Minecraft 1.8 to add the Melon Bomber gamemode from Garry's Mod.

### Features:
* Game rounds
* Upgrade pickups
* Sliding exploding melons

Melon Bomber is my second minigame plugin creation which which I was developing for a test hub server. I wanted to experiment implementing a gamemode idea from one of my favorite games, Garry's Mod. Overall it turned out to be very enjoyable to play but lacks core features such as stat saving and multi-server support. The plugin was created in 2015 and serves as a benchmark for anyone interested in the creation of Minecraft minigame plugins.
